# IdaSky-Forcast
A repository to use in databricks to predict Idaho weather.

We want to build a model that makes predictions based off current temperatures for various Idaho weather stations. We will predict hourly, and weekly temperatures. Predictions will automatically create graphs and then we can even use leaflet to display real time graphs of Idaho wth shaded regions for color.

Perhaps we extend to the entire US?
